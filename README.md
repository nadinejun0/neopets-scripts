# Neopets User Scripts

A collection of user scripts that enhance the Neopets.com experience by adding QoL improvements to various site functionality. Updated periodically

## Scripts

### ðŸ’¬ Neoboards User Buttons (v1.3)
Quick action buttons for interacting with other users on the boards.

**What it does**: Adds "Neomail User" and "Copy Username" buttons next to every post  
**Why it's useful**: Send messages or copy usernames without manually typing them

### Lab Ray Pet Grid (v3.0)
See all your pets at once on the Lab Ray page instead of scrolling through a carousel.

**What it does**: Replaces the pet carousel with a clean grid showing all pets  
**Why it's useful**: Faster pet selection, no more endless click-scrolling

### Neopets Message Cleaner (v0.7)
Keep your Neomail inbox organized with automated cleanup options.

**What it does**: Bulk delete messages based on your preferences (read status, age, keywords)  
**Why it's useful**: Clean up hundreds of old messages in seconds instead of deleting one by one  
**Customization**: Edit the script settings to change deletion criteria, message age thresholds, and keyword filters

### URL Linkifier (v1.7)
Turn plain text URLs into clickable links on the Neoboards. (I'm aware there are browser extensions that offer the same benefit, but found they don't work well on Neopets)

**What it does**: Makes URLs clickable in posts and signatures  
**Why it's useful**: Click links directly instead of copy-pasting them into your browser  
**Works with**: Neopets pages, DTI, Jellyneo item database

### Neolodge Auto-Settings (v1.0)
Automatically remembers and restores your last used lodge booking settings.

**What it does**: Saves your last booking choices (pet, hotel, length, etc.)  
**Why it's useful**: Skip the setup and book your usual stay with one click - no need to re-select preferences each visit

## Installation
